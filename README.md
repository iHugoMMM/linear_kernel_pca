# linear_kernel_pca
Comparing linear PCA and kernel PCA on de-noising tasks.

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use linear PCA and kernel PCA to de-noise both synthetic and real-world datasets. It replicates key experiments from Mika et al. (1998) and includes a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations and code.

## Repository Structure

- `src-linear_kernel_pca.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and experiments.
- `.gitattributes`: Git configuration file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `src-linear_kernel_pca.ipynb` in your favorite environment.
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the experiments.
